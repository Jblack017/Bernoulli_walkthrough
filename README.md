# You have 100 rooms in the hotel that can be sold.

# Each room costs $220 USD per night

# On an average night, you know that 8% of your hotel guests who book a room donâ€™t show up.

# If overbooked, we have to place customers at another hotel, which costs us $400 USD.

# the probability that both an event will and will not occur is equal to one, or 100%.

# A Bernoulli experiment takes that knowledge and applies it to the observation of event occurances in a given enviornment.
